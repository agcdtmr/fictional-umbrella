## Description

Our calculator, quantify the unpaid work of women. 

How much your unpaid work worth? Do you do more unpaid work than your partner?

To help you better understand how much of your time goes to unpaid labor and how much money that represents, this calculator uses the minimum wage in your country as the base for the working hours.

## What we've learned so far:
- Decision-making and prioritizing: From the start of this project, we seek commonalities or shared interests. At first, we wanted to work with APIs that could help was create a CO2 calculator, but because we were spending a lot of time digging into big sets of data and how we could actually use them, we decided we were not ready for a project so big. The next idea was the unpaid work calculator based on the topic of a book called Invisible Woman by Caroline Criado-Perez that we both have read recently.
- Research: Because the topic is important to us, we wanted to make sure that the research phase of this project is given significance and that the content that we will present is carefully chosen.
- Design: because we don't have experience with graphic design, we wanted to keep it simple and easy, making sure the colors had a good contrast but were simple together. We decided to use Figma because it's straight forward and there is a possibility to collaborate on the same project.
- Using inclusive language.
- Practicing better communication skills.

## Why is it important?
- Unpaid work is mainly done by women around the world
- Unpaid work it’s not optional, it goes from buying and wrapping gifts to relatives to cooking, taking care of the kids or other family members, and even farming. It’s wildly undervalued but essential for the household and the economy to function
- Because the majority of the unpaid work is done by women, they often have to combine paid and unpaid work, enduring longer hours when compared to men. It’s also common that unpaid work gets in the way of paid labor, which contributes to the gender pay gap we see in the world today
- Another impact of unpaid work in the paid working world is the precarity of certain professions
